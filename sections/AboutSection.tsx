        I got my start in programming with a C++ module back in 2015, but it
        didn&apos;t really resonate with me then. During the COVID pandemic, I
        took a Python course on YouTube, and that sparked my passion for
        software development. Since then, I&apos;ve built software for a
        <span className="text-primary font-bold"> fintech startup, </span>a
        <span className="text-primary font-bold"> medtech startup, </span>
        and now an
        <span className="text-primary font-bold"> AI company. </span>

        Outside of coding, you&apos;ll usually find me bouldering, which I love
        for both the physical and mental challenge. I enjoy taking and editing
        photos, jogging around Marina Bay, and rewatching my favorite sitcoms
        like
        <span className="text-primary font-bold"> How I Met Your Mother </span>
        and
        <span className="text-primary font-bold"> The Office. </span>I like to
        keep a good mix of adventure and relaxation in my free time.
