          I got my start in programming with a C++ module back in 2015, but it
          didn’t really resonate with me then. During the COVID pandemic, I took
          a Python course on YouTube, and that sparked my passion for software
          development. Since then, I've built software for a fintech startup, a
          medtech startup, and now an AI company.

          Nowadays, I focus on creating fullstack applications for clients. I
          enjoy understanding their needs and figuring out how to bring their
          ideas to life through smart design and engineering. I aim to build
          solutions that look great and work efficiently, while also exploring
          new tech—whether it's a cool UI library or a backend framework.

          Outside of coding, you’ll usually find me bouldering, which I love for
          both the physical and mental challenge. I enjoy taking and editing
          photos, jogging around Marina Bay, and rewatching my favorite sitcoms
          like *How I Met Your Mother* and *The Office*. I like to keep a good
          mix of adventure and relaxation in my free time.
